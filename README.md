# Recipes
Python project for storing and retrieving recipes. Written in a structure for beginners to fill in the gaps in stages.

Branches `ex1`, `ex2`, ... contain the exercises with `TODO`s in the places where code needs to be filled in.

There is a test suite in `tests/`, allowing for test-driven development - they should initially be failing but should pass when the exercise is successfully completed.

Example solutions can be found on branches such as `ex1-solution`.

## Getting started

- Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
- Get a copy of the git repository locally: `git clone https://github.com/LewisGaul/recipes.git/`.
- Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Change to the branch corresponding to the exercise being worked out, e.g. `git checkout ex1`.
- Run the tests: `python -m pytest` (there should be failures at this point).
- Get working on the `TODO`s dotted around the Python files! Rerun the tests after making changes to check your solution works.
